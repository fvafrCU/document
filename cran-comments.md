Dear CRAN Team,
this is a resubmission of package document 1.0.0.
I have run package profvis on the examples from document() and man() but could
not figure how to reduce cpu times. The package builds, checks and roxgenizes
(chunks of) single R code files. To me, there seems no way to get around these
cpu times. I've again disabled the examples of the package's two main functions,
document() and man(), using \donttest{} to pass R CMD check --as-cran.
I have included the NOTEs from  R CMD check --as-cran --run-donttest. They
affect the two main functions, document() and man(). I have included the output
from running covr on the package below: I heavily test the code. Please see 
https://codecov.io/github/fvafrCU/document?branch=master for third party
results.

I hope this adjustments will take it to CRAN,
best,
Dominik Cullmann
