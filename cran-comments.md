Dear CRAN Team,
I have packaged my version of a wrapper to utils::sekelton.package,
roxgen2::roxygenize and callr::rcmd.
It aims at function definitions not yet part of a package. I've been using it's
predecessor for more than two year, mainly for educational purposes (I know a
lot of people who don't [cd]are writing whole (private) packages).
Hope it may be of use to others.

Best, Dominik Cullmann
