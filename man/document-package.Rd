\description{
extract roxygen2-style and markdown comments from a single R code 
file and convert them to various human-readable formats.
}
\details{
R is a programming language that supports and checks documentation for
program libraries (called `packages'). The package roxygen2 provides a
tool for creating documentation from annotated source code - much like 
doxygen, javadoc and docstrings/pydoc do.

And R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics,
used by people like me who start out hacking down code, eventually pouring
chunks of code into functions (and sometimes even ending up creating and 
documenting packages).
Along that work flow you cannot use R's documentation system, let alone
roxygen2, unless you have come to forge your code into a package.

I am fully aware of the fact that roxygen2 is meant to document packages, 
not single code chunks (see \emph{Note}). 
So should you. Nevertheless I feel the temptation to use
roxygen2-style comments in code chunks that are not part of any package. And
to convert them to pdf for better readability.

\note{
This package is basically a wrapper to 
\enumerate{
    \item \pkg{roxygen2}. It internally creates a temporary package from the
     code files provided (using
     \code{\link[utils:package.skeleton]{utils::package.skeleton}}) 
     which it then passes to roxygen2.
    \item 'R CMD' commands run by \pkg{callr}.
}
