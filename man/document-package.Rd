\title{Document a Single R Code File}
\description{
Have you ever been tempted to create roxygen2-style documentation comments
for one of your functions that was not part of one of your packages (yet)?
This is exactly what this package is about: run roxygen2 on (chunks of) a
single code file.
}
\details{
R is a programming language that supports and checks documentation for
program libraries (called `packages'). The package roxygen2 provides a
tool for creating documentation from annotated source code - much like
doxygen, javadoc and docstrings/pydoc do.

And R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics,
used by people like me who start out hacking down code, eventually pouring
chunks of code into functions (and sometimes even ending up creating and
documenting packages).
Along that work flow you cannot use R's documentation system, let alone
\pkg{roxygen2}, unless you have come to forge your code into a package.

I am fully aware of the fact that \pkg{roxygen2} is meant to document
packages, not single code chunks.
So should you. Nevertheless I feel the temptation to use
roxygen2-style comments in code chunks that are not part of any package. And
to convert them to pdf for better readability.
}
\note{
This package is basically a wrapper to
\enumerate{
    \item \pkg{roxygen2}. It internally creates a temporary package from the
     code files provided (using
     \code{\link[utils:package.skeleton]{utils::package.skeleton}})
     which it then passes to roxygen2.
    \item 'R CMD' commands run by \pkg{callr}.
}
}
\section{Warning}{

This package writes to disk, so \strong{NEVER} run it with superuser powers.

\pkg{docstring}
(\url{https://cran.r-project.org/package=docstring}) also creates temporary
help pages as well but using a different technical approach (allowing you to
view them in the \code{RStudio} help pane). But it creates them from python
style docstring-like comments it then parses into \pkg{roxygen2}. And it
does not write to file so far.
