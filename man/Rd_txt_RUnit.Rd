\description{
Why am I doing this? It want to run \pkg{RUnit} tests from within 
\command{R CMD check}
check and interactively.
Files produced are compared with expected files. 
Now \command{R CMD check} and interactive (and batch) runs of \pkg{RUnit}
give different encodings.
I don't know why, but they do. And this is a rather lousy fix. See the code
for details.
