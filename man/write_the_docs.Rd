\arguments{
\item{package_directory}{The directory containing the package's source.}

\item{file_name}{The name of the file where to write the documentation into.
See \strong{Details}.}

\item{output_directory}{The directory to put the documentation into. You
might want to use \code{\link[base]{dirname}(file_name)}.}

\item{dependencies}{A character vector of package names the functions depend
on.}

\item{sanitize_Rd}{Remove strange characters from \code{Rdconv}?}

\pkg{RUnit}?
Do not bother, this is for Unit testing only.}

What does it?
}
\details{
\code{file_name} will usually be provided by \code{\link{document}} as the
R code file's name. This may, differing from a (temporary) package's name,
contain underscores. If you use the functions directly: stick with the
default, in which case the internally
the  \code{\link[base]{basename}} of your \code{package_directory} will be
used. This should be a good guess.
