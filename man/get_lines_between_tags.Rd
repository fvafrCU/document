\arguments{
\item{file_name}{The name of the R code file to be parsed.}

\item{keep_tagged_lines}{keep tagged lines output?}

\item{begin_pattern}{A pattern that marks the line beginning the roxygen
part.}

\item{end_pattern}{A pattern that marks the line ending the roxygen part.}

\item{from_first_line}{use first line as tagged line if first tag found
matches the end_pattern.}

\description{
get all lines between tagged lines

If you know the file to contain valid roxygen code only, you do not
need to tag any lines if you keep from_first_line and to_last_line both TRUE:
in this case the whole file will be returned.
