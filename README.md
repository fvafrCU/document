# document
Run [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2) on single code files rather than whole packages.
Produce pdf and txt output and display a temporary help page from your interactive R session.


## Introduction
Please read the [vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fvafrCU/document/blob/master/inst/doc/Introduction_to_document.html).

Or, after installation, the help page:

```r
help("document-package", package = "document")
```

```
# document a single R code file.
# 
# Description:
# 
#      extract roxygen2-style and markdown comments from a single R code
#      file and convert them to various human-readable formats.
# 
# Details:
# 
#      R is a programming language that supports and checks documentation
#      for program libraries (called `packages'). The package roxygen2
#      provides a tool for creating documentation from annotated source
#      code - much like doxygen, javadoc and docstrings/pydoc do.
# 
#      And R is a free software environment for statistical computing and
#      graphics, used by people like me who start out hacking down code,
#      eventually pouring chunks of code into functions (and sometimes
#      even ending up creating and documenting packages). Along that work
#      flow you cannot use R's documentation system, let alone roxygen2,
#      unless you have come to forge your code into a package.
# 
#      I am fully aware of the fact that roxygen2 is meant to document
#      packages, not single code chunks (see _Note_).  So should you.
#      Nevertheless I feel the temptation to use roxygen2-style comments
#      in code chunks that are not part of any package. And to convert
#      them to pdf for better readability.
# 
# Warning:
# 
#      This package writes to disk, so *NEVER* run it with superuser
#      powers.
# 
# Note:
# 
#      This package is basically a wrapper to
# 
#        1. 'roxygen2'. It internally creates a temporary package from
#           the code files provided (using 'utils::package.skeleton')
#           which it then passes to roxygen2.
# 
#        2. 'R CMD' commands run by 'callr'.

## Installation
You can install document from github with:

```r
if (! require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("fvafrCU/document", quiet = TRUE)
```
