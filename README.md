# document

## Introduction
Please read the [vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fvafrCU/document/blob/master/inst/doc/Introduction_to_document.html).

Or, after installation, the help page:

```r
help("document-package", package = "document")
```

```
# Document a Single R Code File
# 
# Description:
# 
#      Have you ever been tempted to create roxygen2-style documentation
#      comments for one of your functions that was not part of one of
#      your packages (yet)? This is exactly what this package is about:
#      running roxygen2 on (chunks of) a single code file.
# 
# Details:
# 
#      R is a programming language that supports and checks documentation
#      for program libraries (called `packages'). The package roxygen2
#      provides a tool for creating documentation from annotated source
#      code - much like doxygen, javadoc and docstrings/pydoc do.
# 
#      And R is a free software environment for statistical computing and
#      graphics, used by people like me who start out hacking down code,
#      eventually pouring chunks of code into functions (and sometimes
#      even ending up creating and documenting packages). Along that work
#      flow you cannot use R's documentation system, let alone
#      'roxygen2', unless you have come to forge your code into a
#      package.
# 
#      I am fully aware of the fact that 'roxygen2' is meant to document
#      packages, not single code chunks. So should you. Nevertheless I
#      feel the temptation to use roxygen2-style comments in code chunks
#      that are not part of any package. And to convert them to pdf for
#      better readability.
# 
# Warning:
# 
#      This package writes to disk, so *NEVER* run it with superuser
#      powers.
# 
# Note:
# 
#      This package is basically a wrapper to
# 
#        1. 'roxygen2'. It internally creates a temporary package from
#           the code files provided (using 'utils::package.skeleton')
#           which it then passes to roxygen2.
# 
#        2. 'R CMD' commands run by 'callr'.

# 
# See Also:
# 
#      'docstring' (<URL: https://cran.r-project.org/package=docstring>)
#      also creates temporary help pages as well but using a different
#      technical approach (allowing you to view them in the 'RStudio'
#      help pane). But it creates them from python style docstring-like
#      comments it then parses into 'roxygen2'. And it does not write to
#      file so far.
```
## Installation
You can install document from github with:
